# Groups_algorithm

An algorithm that maximises that number of people each student in a class meets over the course of a number of group exercises.
Groups are randomly allocated, avoiding placing two students who have worked before together.

*** Work in progress **: Currently allocates n groups based on a list of n*4 students, whilst creating a group memory
