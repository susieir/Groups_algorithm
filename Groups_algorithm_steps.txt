Challenge: 
Create an algorithm which randomly assigns a list of students to a group
The algorithm should maximise the number of people each person meets over several iterations

Parameters:
Students = 80
Group size = 4

Steps:
1. Create a list of students
2. Initialise a lookup that will keep a record of who each student has worked with
3. For a given number of iterations:
	3.1 Until the list of students is empty/for the number of required groups (80/4=20):
		3.1.1 Create a empty set, to which students will be added
		3.1.2 Create a loop that runs until the size of the set is 4 (the group size)
			3.1.2.1 Randomly select a student from the list and add to the set
			3.1.2.2 Remove the student from the student list
			3.1.2.3 Create a loop that runs three more times to add the remaining students to the list:
				3.1.2.3.1 Randomly select a another student from the list
				3.1.2.3.2 Use the lookup to check if this student has not previously worked with any student in the set
					3.1.2.3.2.1 If the student has not previously worked with any student in the set - add to list
					3.1.2.3.2.2 Otherwise go back to step 3.1.2.3.2 and repeat
